 * catch SIGINT to shut down cleanly

failure resistance / security:
 * support more algorithms (AES, DH group 1, SHA1)
 * timed context cleanup runs
 * malloc() -> xmalloc() xfree()

nice to have features:
 * daemon mode: -d (implies -q)

added sugar:
 * multi shared secret support, multi gateway support [from config file]
