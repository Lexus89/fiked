correctness:
 * test with cisco client
 * catch SIGINT to leave main loop
 * malloc() safety
 * find remaining memory leaks

failure resistance / security:
 * support more algorithms (AES, DH group 1, SHA1)
 * timed context cleanup runs
 * chroot / drop privs

nice to have features:
 * timestamped logging
 * verbose log file: -L
 * quiet: -q (don't log to stdout)
 * daemon mode: -d (implies -q)
 * multi shared secret support, multi gateway support
 * pf integration (add gateway to rdr, excempt already snarfed from rdr)

legal:
 * switch to GPL
 * rewrite source header accordingly
 * write up docs
 * package it
 * make public
