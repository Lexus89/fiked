functionality:
 * implement pf rdr w/hostap (scripts)

correctness:
 * test with cisco client
 * catch SIGINT to leave main loop
 * malloc() safety
 * find remaining memory leaks

failure resistance / security:
 * dup-save recv() (detect resends)
 * support more algorithms (AES, DH group 1, SHA1)
 * timed context cleanup runs
 * chroot / drop privs

nice to have features:
 * timestamped logging facility w/syslog and file options
 * password file: -p
 * verbose log file: -l
 * quiet: -q
 * daemon mode: -d (implies -q)
 * add config file with ipsec_id:secret pairs
 * pf integration (exempt from rdr) or generic --script facility

legal:
 * rename to pskxauthmitmd or similar
 * switch to GPL
 * rewrite source header accordingly
 * write up docs
 * package it
 * make public
