basic functionality:
 * implement phase 2 crypto
 * implement xauth begin
 * implement modecfg xauth dispatcher
 * implement xauth reply

correctness:
 * catch SIGINT to leave main loop
 * malloc() safety
 * find remaining memory leaks

failure resistance:
 * dup-save recv() (detect resends)
 * timed context cleanup runs

nice to have features:
 * timestamped logging facility w/syslog and file options
 * daemon mode (-d)
 * add config file with ipsec_id:secret pairs

legal:
 * switch to GPL
 * make public
