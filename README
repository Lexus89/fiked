// Overview

This is a fake IKE daemon supporting just enough of the standards and
Cisco extensions to attack commonly found insecure Cisco PSK+XAUTH VPN
setups.

Basically, if you know the pre-shared key, also known as shared secret
or group password, you can impersonate the VPN gateway in IKE phase 1,
and learn XAUTH user credentials in phase 2.

This attack [1] is not new.  It has been known for a long time that IKE
using PSK with XAUTH is insecure, and this is not the first actual
implementation of the attack.

The configuration supported by fiked is IKE aggressive mode using
pre-shared keys and XAUTH.  Supported algorithms are DES, 3DES, AES128,
AES192, AES256; MD5, SHA1; and DH groups 1, 2 and 5.  Main mode is not
supported.

Based on this work, a full MITM attack could be implemented.



// Attack Setup

To successfully demostrate an attack on a VPN site, you need to know the
shared secret, and you must be able to intercept the IKE traffic between
the clients and the VPN gateway.

There are several ways to find out the shared secret, and several ways
to redirect the IKE traffic to your running fiked instance.  I have
successfully implemented the attack under lab conditions with hostap and
pf rdr.

With the -r option, you can control whether fiked should forge the
source address on packets or not, depending on whether your particular
attack setup needs it or not.



// Installation

You need these libraries to build and run fiked:
 * libgcrypt >= 1.1.90
   http://directory.fsf.org/security/libgcrypt.html
 * libnet >= 1.1.0
   http://www.packetfactory.net/projects/libnet/

Fiked has been developed and tested on FreeBSD.  You might need to do
some minor tweaking to compile it on other platforms, but the code
should be fairly standard C99.  Please do send me patches though.

You should be able to build and install fiked by just running GNU
make install (gmake on BSD).



// Credits

Fiked is loosely based on VPNC [2].  The code borrowed from VPNC is
found in the vpnc subdirectory, see vpnc/NOTICE.
